# 🧠 Phom

**Explain to Learn, Learn to Explain**  
A reflective learning platform that helps users strengthen understanding by _teaching what they learn_ — guided by intelligent feedback from **K2 Think**.

---

## 🌍 Overview

**Phom** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built to transform how modern learners study.  
Instead of passive memorization, users explain topics in their own words — and Phom, powered by **K2 Think**, listens, analyzes, and challenges them with reflective questions to reveal gaps in understanding.

Whether you’re a student, professional, or lifelong learner, Phom helps you develop the core skill of **critical explanation** — the foundation of deep learning.
